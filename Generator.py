Iterable : { __iter__() or getitems() } The object is iterable like string, list, tuple, set
Iterator :  Traverse the iterable object using __iter__() and next()--> sometime along with yield also
Iteration: Iteration of iterable object one by one (Overall, iteration is process which iterate the object)
