What is Coroutine?
-->> Coroutine is a function which used to pause the execution at yield and later resume from same point when it is reached
Why do needs Coroutine?
--> It needs to handle long running task effectively.
--> It avoid blocking entire program. 
--> preform work in step by step instead of at once. 

> In working context: It use basically, in large and complex project

""" 
Asynchronous -> Non-blocking execution or Concurrent execution (Concurrent means in CS happening at the same time but simantaneously).
Async I/O is a powerful programming pattern that allows for high-performance and concurrent I/O operations in Python.
With the asyncio module and asynchronous functions, you can write efficient and scalable
code that can handle large amounts of data and I/O operations without blocking the main thread.
Whether you're working on web applications, network services, or data processing pipelines, async IO is an essential tool for any Python developer.
